Filess V1 was finally released into production in July of 2022, after a couple months of Beta and development. The project idea was thanks to @max_prihodk0 who helped co-start it. The project is built on the Flask framework with both the website and postgres database hosted by Heroku. Files are stored in an ACL regulated AWS S3 bucket and email verification is established through Google's OAuth2 API.

This is a public release of the website, meaning that sensitive data such as OAuth2 credential files and certain keys were removed. Feel free to look around at the website's structure and logic, however. Cheers!
